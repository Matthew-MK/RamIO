# RamIO

A real-time, multiplayer, HTML5 game using Node, Express, SocketIO, 
PostgreSQL, and others. It was inspired by games like inspired by Agar.io 
and Slither.io

Final project for Fall 2016 COMP426 @ UNC.

It was due on 2016.12.06. Even though we got an A, 
I wanted to continue to work on the project to refine it and turn it
 into something more complete. As of the due
date I have been the only continuing contributor. If that changes, I will
update this README.
