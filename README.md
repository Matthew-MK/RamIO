# RamIO

Final project for Fall 2016 COMP426 @ UNC.

A real-time, multiplayer, HTML5 game using Node, Express, SocketIO, 
PostgreSQL, and others. It was inspired by games like inspired by Agar.io 
and Slither.io

It was due on 2016.12.06 and even though we got an A, 
I have continued working on it.

To see the project we turned in use:

<em>$ git checkout assignment</em>

To switch back to current version:

<em>$ git checkout master</em>
